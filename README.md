This was presented as a final project from Operational Systems and Control Systems Engineering classes from the Technological University of Parana (UTFPR - Universidade Tecnológica Fereal do Paraná).
From the operational systems class, the requirements were to build an embedded system using an RTOS implementation with at least 4 Threads running concurrently, 1 sensor and 2 actuators. An internet connectivity was a bonus point.
From the Control Systems Engineering class, the requirements were to model the behavior of a system, simulate it using SimuLink and design a discrete compensator to compensate a system variable.
